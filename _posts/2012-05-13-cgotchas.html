+, - have higher precedence than >>, <<.

<p>
a/b if a or b is negative, its result is implementation-dependent (truncated to or from 0) prior to C99, and truncated to 0 by C99.  The standard specifies that (a/b)*b + a%b is equal to a.

<h3>Array name vs. pointer</h3>
<p>
Usually an array name is transformed to be a pointer to the first element of the array.  But in following situations an array name is not equivalent to a pointer to the first element of the array:
<ul>
<li>as an operand of <code>sizeof</code> operator</li>
<li>as an operand of <code>&</code> operator</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The declaration of an array and its definition must be compatible, only except as a parameter of a function, in which the declaration of an array is equivalent to the declaration of a pointer.  Particularly you must not define a variable to be an array in one file and declare it to be a pointer in another file.
